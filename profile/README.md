# UCSD Historical Enrollment Data
This organization contains enrollment data for courses at UC San Diego and relevant project files for gathering and processing that data.

The **[UCSDHistEnrollData repository](https://github.com/UCSD-Historical-Enrollment-Data/UCSDHistEnrollData/)** serves as the starting/welcome (informational) repository for this organization. It contains information about the project as a whole, including but not limited to: documentation, scraping methods, and ways to contact the maintainers. Please read through that repository's README before exploring the data. 

Enrollment data is organized so that each repository represents a term. Pinned repositories either represent major projects (e.g., the scraper, the library, and the aforementioned informational repository), or the repository representing data for the active enrollment term.

## Third-Party Projects
The aforementioned informational repository has links to several third-party projects (i.e., projects created by people outside of this organization) that may be helpful to people who are just looking for enrollment history, without needing to go through the data manually or read cryptic graphs.
