# UCSD Historical Enrollment Data
This organization contains enrollment data for courses at UC San Diego and relevant project files for gathering and processing that data. For more information about this project, **please see [this repository](https://github.com/UCSD-Historical-Enrollment-Data/UCSDHistEnrollData)**.

Enrollment data is organized so that each repository represents a term. Pinned repositories either represent major projects (e.g., the scraper, the library, and the aforementioned informational repository), or the repository representing data for the active enrollment term.
